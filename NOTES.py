#-----------NOTES--------------
# To use this program, run Main.py!

# 1. Clean up combustion and combustion optimiser connection, they both do
# the same thing. DONE

# 2. Fix ratio graph printing twice. DONE

# 3. Assumed exit pressure = atmospheric pressure, no introduction of pressure
# difference in thrust equation, could implement this for future purposes.

# 4. Any point making a GUI for user interface?

# 5. Convergent section and combustion chamber need improvement.

# 6. MASS FLOW RATE EQ
